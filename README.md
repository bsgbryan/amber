# Hi from Amber ðŸ˜Š

Amber is a thoroughly modern game editor.

What does that mean?

1. Amber is easy to get along with:<br>
  _Modern technologies and tools like [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), and [WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) enable Amber to be simple to use & work with while also being incredibly efficient_
1. Amber is smol:<br>
  _A long-standing axiom in development is "Smaller things are easier to understand, change, and fix"; Amber follows this axiom by using lots of little pieces, each focused on doing a single thing, to construction nuanced behavior_
1. Amber has strong opinions:<br>
  _"Simple" and "flexible" are, often, antithetical; whenever this is the case, Amber simplifies things for you and I by making an opinionated decision - meaning that there absolutely is an "Amber's Way"_

# Ambers Parts

* **[Athenaeum](./src/lib/Athenaeum):** A colleciton of super-useful things.
* **[Eunomia](./src/lib/Eunomia):** Just a little thing that keeps the engine in good running order.
* **[Finesse](./src/lib/Finesse):** Flexible, sensible, shockingly-adept input handling.
* **[Kali](./src/lib/Kali):** A tiny tool that makes scaling time in the engine as easy as a single method call.
* **[Legion](./src/lib/src/lib/Legion):** An implementation of the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) design pattern.
* **Strata:** UI tooling. It's all of Amber's buttons, switches, dialogs, and stuff.
* **[Xenon](./src/lib/src/lib/Xenon):** A blisteringly-fast, elegant rendering engine.
* **[Yggdrasil](./src/lib/Yggdrasil):** Manages all the FidelityTrees; ensuring the engine is always running at peak perfomance, while hitting the [frame rate](https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/05/understanding-frame-rate-and-its-importance) target you specify.
