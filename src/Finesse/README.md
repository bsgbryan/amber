# Welcome to [Finesse](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/finesse)!

Finesse handles input processing and supports:

* Movement via [keyboard](https://github.com/bsgbryan/roc/blob/main/src/lib/Finesse/input_processors/movement/Keyboard.ts)
* Movement via [gamepad](https://github.com/bsgbryan/roc/blob/main/src/lib/Finesse/input_processors/movement/GamePad.ts)
* Looking around via [mouse](https://github.com/bsgbryan/roc/blob/main/src/lib/Finesse/input_processors/rotation/Mouse.ts)
* Looking around via [gamepad](https://github.com/bsgbryan/roc/blob/main/src/lib/Finesse/input_processors/rotation/GamePad.ts)

Fascinatingly, it supports *combining* movement and looking via any combination you want!

Look via gamepad while moving via mouse, move via keyboard and look via gamepad ðŸ¤¯
