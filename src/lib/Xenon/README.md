# 👽: Greetings, developer

👽: Nice to meet you!<br>
👽: I am a modern, performant, procedural real-time simulation engine

🤓: ... what?

👽: Well, a game engine; but one specifically designed to simulate things - and scale to hit whatever frame rate you specify on whatever hardware I'm running on

🤓: ...

👽: I'm designed to simulate things at 30fps, 60fps, and beyond on everything from a Raspberry Pi to a top-of-the-line, water-cooled, Beast Mode™️ PC

🤓: But ... how?

👽: Well, for example, instead of giving me a static 3D model with [LOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics))s to render<br>
👽: You'd give me a highly-structured hierarchy of nodes, called a **FidelityTree**, populated with specific rules defining how the fidelity of the simulation for a (procedural) 3D model should increase or decrease based on the performance characteristics of the hardware I'm running on<br>
👽: Oh! And **FidelityTree**s describe anything too - not just 3D models;<br>
👽: they can represent AI, a skelaton, a sound/music source ... and<br>
👽: *crucially* FidelityTress only describe **procedural content**<br>
👽: Also, importantly, **FidelityTree**s are all I know how to work with; I actually *can't* handle static resources!

🤓: Ahhh! So ... instead of giving you a bunch of static stuff to render/play,<br>
🤓: I give you a set of **FidelityTree**s ... and you execute the simulations they describe at whatever level of fidelity is appropriate for the hardware you're running on at the framerate I specify?

👽: Yes! Exactly!

🤓: Awesome!<br>
🤓: So ... you're a game engine - you're just a very specific, unique, _type_ of game engine?

👽: You got it!

🤓: Radical
