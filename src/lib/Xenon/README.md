# 👽: Greetings, fellow developer

👽: Nice to meet you!<br>
👽: I am a modern, performant, procedural real-time simulation engine

🤓: ... what?

👽: Well, a game engine; but one specifically designed to simulate things - and scale to hit whatever frame rate you specify on whatever hardware I'm running on

🤓: ...

👽: I'm designed to simulate things at 30fps, 60fps, and beyond on everything from a Raspberry Pi to a top-of-the-line, water-cooled, Beast Mode™️ PC

🤓: But ... how?

👽: Well, for example, instead of giving me a 3D model to render<br>
👽: You'd give me a highly-structured hierarchy of nodes populated with specific rules defining how the fidelity of a 3D model should increase or decrease based on the performance characteristics of the hardware I'm running on<br>
👽: These heirarchy of nodes can represent anything too - not just 3D models<br>
👽: They can represent AI, a skelaton, a sound/music source ...<br>
👽: In fact, these structures, called **FidelityTrees**, are all I know how to work with!

🤓: Ahhh! So ... instead of giving you a bunch of static things to render/play,<br>
🤓: I give you a set of **FidelityTrees** ... and you execute the simulations they describe at whatever level of fidelity is appropriate for the hardware you're running on at the framerate I specify?

👽: Yes! Exactly!

🤓: Awesome!<br>
🤓: So ... you're a game engine - you're just a very specific, unique, _type_ of game engine?

👽: You got it!

🤓: Radical
