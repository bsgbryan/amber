# Welcome to [Benzaiten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzaiten)!

Benzaiten is the module that generates procedural meshes.

She builds a polygonal mesh by sampling an implicit surface from a colleciton of voxels.

She provides a small set of params to balance the fidelity of the generated mesh with the time needed to generate the mesh (_to maintain a consistent framerate_)
